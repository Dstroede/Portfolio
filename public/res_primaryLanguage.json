The application fetches cards dynamically from a data.json file, providing users with the opportunity to click on each card for additional creature details. Moreover, it includes a feature that enables users to filter animals based on the number of horns they possess. To add a touch of personalization, the app also allows users to mark their favorite creatures.",
